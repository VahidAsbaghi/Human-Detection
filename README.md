# Human-Detection
The project is developed in MATLAB 2013 environment.
The subject is 'Human Identity Detection Using Iris Images'.
The project includes a feature extraction algorithm, some useful image processing techniques and filters, Hough transform algorithm, Sobel edge detection operator, and Gabor filter.
The detection rate is about 97 percent on the CASIA V.1 dataset containing eye images of 108 persons.
The project includes a GUI file, named GUI_IR.m. Please run the file in MATLAB 2013 environment and test the results.
If you want to see the result of classification of a single person, use up-left part of the GUI. 
If you want to plot a Gabor filter with specified parameters, you could use the up-right part.
If you want to test the total result of the detection rate on the whole dataset, please use the down-left part. You should select four images out of all 7 images of each person to learn the classifier. The algorithm uses remained 3 images to determine the classification performance. After that, the results will be shown in provided textboxes.
